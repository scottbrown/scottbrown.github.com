I just read a great quote, that perfectly sums up the type of person, 
worker, and friend that I strive to be:

"Have you ever worked with a good manager? They're full of ideas. 
They'll suggest, they'll coach, they'll recommend. They'll cajole and 
beg and plead if they have to. But they won't tell you how to do your 
job, not unless it's a real emergency, anyways. They hired you, they 
gave you a task they know you can handle, and they trust you to make 
the details happen."
