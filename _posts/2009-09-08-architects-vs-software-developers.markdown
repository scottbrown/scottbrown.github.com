Sometimes people have a knack for saying things that hit just a 
little close to home.  Case in point, [this post][ref-1].

I'm working on a project right now where the clients have this 
type of mentality, and I can certainly understand where this post 
is coming from.  I often wonder if any other type of structural 
engineer (I'm using the word 'engineer' loosely here) like software 
developers, architects, or product prototype designers have similar 
experiences when dealing with new clients and their projects.

If you are a software developer, please give the post a read and 
hopefully you will relate to it.

If you are a client, please give this post a read and reflect on 
its content so that you can hopefully prevent yourself from making 
the types of insane requests of which it speaks.
