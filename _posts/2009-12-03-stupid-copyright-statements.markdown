Here's something I came across yesterday that had me in disbelief over 
someone's attempt at copyright.

Now, what happens when I view this page (or any subsequent pages) in my 
web browser?  I'm storing a digital copy in my local "repository" (read: 
browser cache).  So right away I'm breaking copyright law.  I'm pretty 
sure that I'm also breaking copyright law by taking a screenshot of the 
copyright statement itself.  Now how's that for meta!
